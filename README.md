# THE WORST AI

I want to try to do some ai shit, python came to my mind so im doing it with it, probably its gonna be the worst code the humankind has ever seen, but whatever
the only external library im gonna be using is pygame, the rest is gonna be a problem for the future me, hope he wont get mad at me :)

The goal is to make an ai that gets the points in the grid as quick as possible without touching the death cells

**Current state:**
Every simulation ends in the corner with the lowest score posible ðŸ’€
In way worst at python than I thought
